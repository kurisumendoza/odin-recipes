# odin-recipes

The first project of the Foundations course of The Odin Project.
In this project, I am expected to create a basic HTML webpage by following a given set of instructions.
By the end of this project, I am assuming that the knowledge I learned in previous lessons about HTML will be ingrained in my memory. Moreover, I will also be more acquainted in using Git and GitHub.
